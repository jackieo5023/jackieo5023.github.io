        <h1>Hi, I'm Jacqueline. This website is a work in progress :)</h1>
        <h2>In the meantime - read some stuff about me!</h2>
        <p>I'm a self proclaimed nerd - I'm a gigantic Harry Potter and Game of Thrones fan, I watch a lot of anime, play too many video games, and I love nerdy puns <b>maybe</b> a bit too much.
        <br/>I guess you may be wondering, "does this girl do anything other than just watch anime and read Game of Thrones theories all day?"  And the answer would be - surprisingly - yes!  On the off chance that I have a large chunk of free time and I'm not dead tired, I like to rock climb!  I also love hanging out with my friends and exploring, no matter where I am.  Big cities are the best to wander around, since you'll never know what you'll find (like <a href="http://highfiveramen.com/" target="_blank">a random hipster ramen restaurant in Chicago</a>).</p>
